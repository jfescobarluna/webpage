# Projects & Case Studies

I carried out a diagnosis on the health-tourism industry of the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga. The background of my work was an analysis of the competitive advantages, market demand, and operational problems in the region based on surveys, interviews, and data on the sector. The research was able to find the structure gaps in the service coordination, international promotion, and standardized service packages.

The results presented useful recommendations to local institutions and service providers, for planning purposes, and the potential clients to be reached. As this sector presented opportunities to be a potential enhancer of regional development.
